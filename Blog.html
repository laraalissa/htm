   <p>The Agile Scrum
People often speak of Agile and Scrum together when talking about software development methodology. Well, they are not wrong as the two are closely related. The Agile model is a process which enables multiple software teams to collaborate in a flexible framework using incremental and iterative time-boxes or sprints to break down work cycles.
